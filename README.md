YouTube offers the tool YouTube Studio for content creators to manage their channels more effectively.

Before, this tool was called Creator Studio. Still, the goal was the same as today: make it easier for creators to manage their channel through a control dashboard. A ‘must’ for any content creator.

To access this tool, simply click on your icon, located at the top right, and tap the option ‘YouTube Studio’.

## How YouTube Studio works

Once you click on YouTube Studio, you will be taken to the channel dashboard by default. You can analyze the channel analytics, upload videos or live broadcasts, and see what’s new in Studio.

Is this all there is? Not at all. YouTube Studio is much more than a control dashboard. You will see that on the left sidebar column, you can manage everything related to your channel.

The Creator Studio’s interface is customizable so you can add or remove widgets based on the tools that you most commonly use.

On the main dashboard of the Creator Studio, you will see a menu that includes your video manager, live streaming support, community page, channel page, analytics, translations, and transcriptions.

Also on the dashboard, you can see analytics for the most successful videos that you have posted.
